# Predicted Energy Consumption in Steel  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting electricity consumption in the steel industry using a **linear regression model**. By analyzing historical energy usage data, the model helps optimize production processes and reduce unnecessary energy waste.  

## 🔍 Key Features  
- **Data Validation**: Checked data completeness and assessed normality distribution before model training.  
- **Model Development**: Built and trained a linear regression model using **Scikit-learn**.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measured model accuracy using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.  
- **Visualization**: Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to present insights effectively.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
